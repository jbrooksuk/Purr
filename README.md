Purr is the [Durr](http://skreksto.re/products/durr) Pebble watch face. It vibrates gently every 5 minutes reminding you of live and putting you back in the now.

# Icon
Yes, I know the icon is poo. It sucks. I'm not a designer, heck, Purr doesn't even have any text in it. If you fancy making some better visuals, please, be my guest. Just add a pull request!
